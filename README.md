1. Have these values, car manufactures year, car price and car name. Then pass a value which can calculate car price multiply car manufactured year.

2. Create a new private and public classes that can get at least 3 cars, model, make and price from the terminal, and then calculate the average prices of the cars and show it in the terminal. 

2.1 Use the code in assignment 2 and use if and else statement so, if the average car prices are higher than the 100,000 the output shows expensive. If it's between 50,000 to 99,999, the output shows it's normal and if it's less than 49,999 it shows the cars are cheap 

2.2 Do the same as 2.1 just instead of if and else statment use ternary operator
